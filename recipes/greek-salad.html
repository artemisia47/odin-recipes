    <h1>Greek Salad</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Greece, Horiatiki or Greek village salad, is served most often from early spring to the early part of fall.
        And it's truly the best use of the season's quality produce including juicy tomatoes, cucumbers, green bell
        peppers, and onions.</p>
    <h2>Ingedients</h2>
    <li>Tomatoes - Roma tomatoes or vine-ripe tomatoes will work well in this salad. Choose Perfect ripe tomatoes that
        are somewhat firm but yielding slightly to the touch.</li>
    <li>Cucumbers- I prefer English cucumbers which are seedless and tend to be sweeter in taste. Choose firm,
        smooth-skinned cucumbers. </li>
    <li>Onions- I like red onions in this salad. And if you want to take the edge off, soak your sliced onions in a
        solution of iced water mixed with vinegar for a bit before adding them to the salad (I do this in the video
        below).</li>
    <li>Olives- Greek kalamata olives are the ones to use here, but black olives will work also.</li>
    <li>Bell peppers- Green bell peppers are typically used. Choose firm and smooth looking green bell pepper. No other
        colored bell peppers are used in a traditional Greek salad.</li>
    <li>Creamy feta cheese - If at all possible, use quality Greek feta made from sheepâ€™a milk. Never crumble the feta,
        cut it into large chunks and add it on top of the salad.</li>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cut the vegetables into large slices or chunks. The base ingredients of tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers
            and onions are typically cut in large slices or chunks and served in a bowl (or in a small bowl for each
            individual).</li>
        <li>Use pitted kalamata olives or black olives and assemble them on top of your vegetables.</li>
        <li>Season with a dash of kosher salt and dried oregano. I like to finish with a bit more dried oregano at the
            end.</li>

        <li>Drizzle with good extra virgin olive oil and a splash of red wine vinegar. OR, place bottles
            of oil and vinegar on the table so that each person can dress the salad to their liking.</li>
        <li>Add blocks of feta (never crumbled feta) on top.</li>

        <li>Serve immediately! </li>
    </ol>
