    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In Greece, Horiatiki or Greek village salad, is served most often from early spring to the early part of fall.
        And it's truly the best use of the season's quality produce including juicy tomatoes, cucumbers, green bell
        peppers, and onions.</p>
<h2>Ingedients</h2>
<li>Tomatoes - Roma tomatoes or vine-ripe tomatoes will work well in this salad. Choose Perfect ripe tomatoes that are somewhat firm but yielding slightly to the touch.</li>
<li>Cucumbers- I prefer English cucumbers which are seedless and tend to be sweeter in taste. Choose  firm, smooth-skinned cucumbers. </li>
<li>Onions- I like red onions in this salad. And if you want to take the edge off, soak your sliced onions in a solution of iced water mixed with vinegar for a bit before adding them to the salad (I do this in the video below).</li>
<li>Olives- Greek kalamata olives are the ones to use here, but black olives will work also.</li>
<li>Bell peppers- Green bell peppers are typically used. Choose firm and smooth looking green bell pepper. No other colored bell peppers are used in a traditional Greek salad.</li>
<li>Creamy feta cheese - If at all possible, use quality Greek feta made from sheepâ€™a milk. Never crumble the feta, cut it into large chunks and add it on top of the salad.</li>
